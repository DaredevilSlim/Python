from typing import Iterable

# Given an iterable of ints , create and return a new iterable whose first two elements are the same as in items, after
# which each element equals the median element in the list of the three elements from the original list. This list of
# three ends on the current position, first two elements are going just before the third element.
# Wait...You don't know what the "median" is? Go check out the separate "Median" mission on CheckiO.
# Input: Iterable of ints.
# Output: Iterable of ints.
# The mission was taken from Python CCPS 109 Fall 2018. Itâ€™s being taught for Ryerson Chang School of Continuing
# Education by Ilkka Kokkarinen
