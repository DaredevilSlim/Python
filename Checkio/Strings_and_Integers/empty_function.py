# Keeping in memory your knowledge about variables and operations with them let's make a step aside and talk about
# functions. Function is a block of code, that may be used multiple times in different places. Usually function gets
# some input data (parameters), make some operations with them and returns some value outside.
# 1. In this mission you need to define a function func, which takes no arguments.
# 2. Your function is also not going to do anything! To keep a code (expression) working correctly without doing
# anything you need to use so called placeholders: keyword pass or ... operator.
# 3. Note that even if a function returns nothing, it returns the empty value None anyway.
def func():
    pass


print(func())
