# Check if the given year is leap year. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years
# which must be divisible by 400. This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, although 1900 was not.
# Input: Integer (int).
# Output: Logic value (bool).
# How itâ€™s used: this function can be used in calendars, scheduling applications, or any system which deals with yearly
# data.
# Precondition:
# 1 <= year <= 105
