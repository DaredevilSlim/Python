# This function should take an list of strings and determine the longest common prefix among all the strings. If there
# is no common prefix, it should return an empty string.
# Input: List of strings (str).
# Output: String (str).
# How itâ€™s used:
# in autocomplete systems to suggest the most likely completion;
# in file systems to suggest directory names based on current input;
# in DNA sequence alignment to identify common substrings.
