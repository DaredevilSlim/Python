# A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself. For example,
# 28 is a perfect number because its divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14, and their sum is 28.
# Input: Integer (int).
# Output: Logic value (bool).
# How itâ€™s used: perfect numbers have a historical significance in number theory and have been studied in various
# mathematical and mystical contexts. This function could be useful in mathematical research, cryptography, or just
# general problem-solving.
# Precondition:
# 1 <= n <= 108
