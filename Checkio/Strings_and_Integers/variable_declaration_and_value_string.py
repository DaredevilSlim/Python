# 1. In this very first mission you just need to declare two variables a, b and set their values to integers 2, 5
# respectively.
# 2. When done, try to set values for variables in a single line (first variables gets first value etc.). While Python
# remains a dynamically typed language, meaning you don't have to specify types for variables, incorporating type
# annotations, especially in larger projects or when working in a team, can significantly enhance code quality and
# maintainability. It's worth noting that type annotations are optional, and Python will not enforce strict typing;
# they serve primarily as a development aid and documentation tool.
# 3. For integers use int type. Rewrite the first variant with type annotation.
a, b = (2, 5)
print(a, b)
