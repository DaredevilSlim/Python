# 1. Let's add another two variables with more "speaking" names add, multi and set their values to the expressions of
# sum and product respectively of the previously declared variables a, b.
# 2. Using expressions allows you to freely change a, b values later and still get correct values of add, multi. Try to
# change a, b values and press Check Solution again. If you write expressions for add, multi you still pass
# this mission.
a, b = (2, 5)
print(a, b)
add = a + b
print(add)
multi = a * b
print(multi)
