# The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s. Pocket-sized devices became available in
# the 1970s, especially after the Intel 4004, the first microprocessor, was developed by Intel for the Japanese
# calculator company Busicom. They later became used commonly within the petroleum industry (oil and gas). Find more on

# In this series of missions you are going to build an elementary calculator.
# As an input, you get a sequence of keys pressed, and, as the result of that function, you should show what will be
# shown on the screen when the last key is pressed. Be attentive, it's not always the result of the expression.
# Actually, playing with the physical calculator or app will really help you to catch edge cases.
# In the first mission only digits and single signs (only +, -, =) between them are used.
# Expected behavior:
# beginning zeros should be removed, only-zeros number - converted to single zero.
# Input: String.
# Output: String.
# How itâ€™s used: Calculators are widely used. Understanding the principles of its input and output are interesting and
# useful.
# Precondition: Allowed characters: digits (0-9), single signs plus (+), minus (-) or equation (=) between digit blocks.
# NO combinations of signs (+=, +- etc.).
