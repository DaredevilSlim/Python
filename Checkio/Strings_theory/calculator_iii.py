# The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s. Pocket-sized devices became available in
# the 1970s, especially after the Intel 4004, the first microprocessor, was developed by Intel for the Japanese
# calculator company Busicom. They later became used commonly within the petroleum industry (oil and gas). Find more on
# wikipedia page...
# In this series of missions you are going to build an elementary calculator.
# As an input, you get a sequence of keys pressed, and, as the result of that function, you should show what will be
# shown on the screen when the last key is pressed. Be attentive, it's not always the result of the expression.
# Actually, playing with the physical calculator or app will really help you to catch edge cases.
# In this mission the combinations of signs are presented.
# Expected behavior:
# beginning zeros should be removed, only-zeros number - converted to single zero;
# among +- signs between numbers, the last one should be taken;
# "==" means repeating the last operation;
# "+=" or "-=" - adding/subtracting the number (or operations result) before the combination (doubling the
# number/subtracting itself).
# the calculator ignores digit you enter after 5th;
# "-" for numbers < 0 is NOT taking digit place;
# if the abs(result) is more than 99999 - "error" is shown as a result.
# Input: String.
# Output: String.
# How itâ€™s used: Calculators are widely used. Understanding the principles of its input and output are interesting and
# useful.
# Precondition: Allowed characters: digits (0-9), signs plus (+), minus (-) or equation (=) and their combinations
# (+=, +-, == etc.). The number may contain no more than 5 digits.
