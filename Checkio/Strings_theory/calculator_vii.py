# The HP 12c financial calculator is still produced. It was introduced in 1981 and is still being made with few changes.
# The HP 12c featured the reverse Polish notation mode of data entry. In 2003 several new models were released,
# including an improved version of the HP 12c, the "HP 12c platinum edition" which added more memory, more built-in
# functions, and the addition of the algebraic mode of data entry. Find more on wikipedia page...
# In this series of missions you are going to build an elementary calculator.
# As an input, you get a sequence of keys pressed, and, as the result of that function, you should show what will be
# shown on the screen when the last key is pressed. Be attentive, it's not always the result of the expression.
# Actually, playing with the physical calculator or app will really helps you to catch edge cases.
# In the seventh mission the memory should be implemented with such operations: capital "A" (add, +), capital "S"
# (subtract, -), capital "G" (get value) and capital "E" (erase memory).
# Expected behavior:
# beginning zeros should be removed, only-zeros number - converted to single zero;
# among +- signs between numbers, the last one should be taken;
# "==" means repeating the last operation;
# "+=" or "-=" - adding/subtracting the number (or operations result) before the combination (doubling the
# number/subtracting itself);
# the calculator ignores digit you enter after 5th;
# "-" for numbers < 0 is NOT taking digit place;
# if the abs(result) is more than 99999 - "error" is shown as a result;
# for float, if the integer part of abs(result) is more then 9999 - "error" is shown as a result;
# for float, in case the total length of number is more than 5 digits, it should be rounded to 5 digits
# (1.23456 -> 1.235);
# for float, beginning and trailing zeros should be removed (until the "." if possible): 0.1200 -> .12 ,
# 123.00 -> 123. . It should be done after the rounding: 1.000123 -> 1. . Stripping of trailing zeros should only be
# done after entering a number has concluded (non-digit character pressed);
# when after B's no signs remain and new digits are pressed - concatenate with the previous number: 12+B3 -> 123 ;
# "A"/"S" increase/decrease memory by previous number with cleaning the output;
# "G" insert memory value if used after operation, clean output and insert value otherwise.
# Input: String.
# Output: String.
# How itâ€™s used: Calculators are widely used. Understanding the principles of its input and output are interesting and
# useful.
# Precondition: Allowed characters: digits (0-9), dot (.), signs +, -, =, *, /, //, %, ** and their combinations (+=,
# +-, ==, %= etc.), letters "B", "C", "A", "S", "G", "E". The integer number may contain no more than 5 digits,
# float - 4.
